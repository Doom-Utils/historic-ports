Programming Notes:
  -This code is for the djgpp compiler, v2.01.
     Get it at www.delorie.com/djgpp/

  -You now need allegro 3.0 + the Work-In-Progress update to compile it.
   It is used for a lot of the dos-specific routines.
     Get it at http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/

  -You also need BCD, a cd-audio playing library to compile dosdoom.
     Get It http://brennan.home.ml.org/programming/

  -The DOSDoom Team uses RHIDE V1.4 as the programming enviroment,
   therefore use RHIDE to compile. (Get it at the same place as DJGPP). 

  -All of doom's KEY_* vars have been renamed to KEYD_* because allegro
   uses KEY_ variables
  
  -If you recompile the code you'll probably get an exe thats much larger
   than the one in this release.  That is because the disturbed exe is
   compressed with djp.  DJP can probably be obtained from the same place
   you got djgpp.

  -The enable greater error checking in DOSDoom add -DDEVELOPERS to the
   compile options.

  -A lot of the code has 'until DDF' beside it. Due to work being
   done to rationalise DOSDoom and make it logical and lot of changes
   are in progress and these bits of code will be removed when DDF is
   setup.

  -See the LOG directory for changes and work done.
