Whats new (in v0.64):
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-added needed wads to source dist
-added some troubleshooting notes to the end of the user notes
-sky fixed in all resolutions. Thanks to Matthew J Legowski <legowski+@andrew.cmu.edu>
-Updated Dutch support. Thanks to Arno Slagboom (arnos@freemail.nl)
-Many linux improvements contributed by Eduardo Casino-Almao (eduardo@medusa.es) 
-New music and sound code 
Support for MUS, MOD and MP3 music files (see music.htm).

http://www.geocities.com/siliconvalley/vista/8890/
- MP3 support based on dosamp based on amp-0.7.5 by Tomislav Uzelac

amp-0.7.5 is by Tomislav Uzelac
- Missile Teleportation off/on/silent
- Player Teleportation Speed normal/quick/quickest
- Fixed the crosshair so it re-adjusts when full screen.
- Pulsating crosshair. 
- Extended network setup packet, sends all the information from the
gameplay menu to all other machines so there are no consistency errors.
- Fixed the demo's so they play properly again, (AdvancedAI was using
P_Random, so the demo's were getting the wrong numbers) There is now a
J_Random :) function which should be used for random numbers for addons to
stop this from re-occuring.
- disabled the gameplay menu also while in a netgame (you can undo
that if you wish, but I personally think it's better to reduce consistency
errors).
-Radius Scripting (player goes within a radius causes an event - check this out!)
Scripting for new levels or existing ones (see radius.htm).
-Options menu reorganised and graphical titles used
-new deadly former humans setting (spider demon is also a nightmare here)
-new startup sequence
-monster respawn setting in the menu
-monster infighting setting in the menu
-graphical titles for menu
-cd audio volume in the menu

User Notes
^^^^^^^^^^
  -use wads from doom v1.9!!!!!!!!
  -networking should only be compatible with doom v1.9 if you don't use extra features
   (ie: everything in gameplay options must be turned off, gravity should be at default)
  -Everything in gameplay options MUST be the same for all computers in
   a network game.
  -played demos should be from doom v1.9
  -if you have an order video card without vesa2 linear frame buffer, you
   might be able to speed up doom by getting SDD at http://www.scitechsoft.com
  -On a slower machine, dosdoom is slower than the original doom.exe, while
   on a newer machine, dosdoom is faster than the original doom.exe
  -using double-buffering may improve speed significantly, but it also could
   slow things down.
  -to do networking, rename dosdoom.exe to doom2.exe and run dm.exe
   (dm.exe is DeathManager which comes with doom v1.9)
  -You could use CapLock to always run - when its on, use shift to walk
  -i pumped up maxvisplanes, maxopenings, maxdrawsegs, maxvissprites, and
   max savegame size for u level designers out there :)
  -If the DOSDOOM environ var exists, dosdoom will look in that directory
   for default.cfg
  -320x100 mode is availiable :)
  -new cheatcode: type 'idkillall' to kill all monsters
  -new cheat code 'idinfo', which will show fps/time/position/kills/etc
   in single player and fps/time in multiplayer
  -'idinfo', 'cdnext', 'cdprev', and 'idmus??' are allowed in deathmatch
  -MIDI support is now in DosDoom - just use the midi file in place of the
   mus file
  -You can press PrintScreen to take a screenshot at any time
  -player 5-8 starts are things 4001-4004 (for you level designers out there)
  -you need a new ipxsetup for 8 player support
  -If the mouse hangs, you could try adding mouse=ms to dosdoom.cfg

   NOTE TO PROGRAMMERS: Please see coders.txt if you wish compile DOSDoom.

New Command Line Parameters:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  -gwaddir dir  Sets the location of the doom wad
  -width ???    Sets x resolution to ??? (default 320)
  -height ???   sets y resolution to ??? (default 200)
  -hicolor      Enables hicolor mode
  -forcevga     Use standard vga for 320x200 even if a vesa mode is availiable
  -dblbuffer    Use hardware double buffering.  Might be faster, especially at
                hi-res and hi-color modes.  You could use timedemo to check.
                This may not work on all computers. (Note: on most video cards,
                this will be slower if you use lotsa translucency)
  -heapsize ??? Sets heapsize to ??? megabytes.  (default 6)  Increase if you
                get out of memory errors at very-high resolutions or big maps
  -censored     Use this to censor quit messages
  -cdaudio      Turns on cd-audio support.  Use the new cheat codes CDNEXT
                and CDPREV to go forward or back a track.  Use IDMUS?? to
                change to a specific track.
  -digmid       Enables software wavetable.  You will have to edit the
                included dosdoom.cfg, so that the patches= line points
                to either a default.cfg file (from a set of GUS patches)
                or a .dat file (which can be created from a SoundFont (.sf2)
                file with the pat2dat utility availiable on my webpage). You
                can get SoundFont files and GUS patches by following the links
                at http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/digmid.html

                and vice-versa.  Only useful with -mlook

                look up/down keys.  (default 1000)

Known Bugs:  (don't email us about them)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  -status bar shows before wipes when using double-buffering
  -very large heapsizes don't work
  -some demos get out of sync in dosdoom
  -Shoot up/down doesn't work in net play.  I'm still thinking of the best
   way to solve it without breaking network compatibility
