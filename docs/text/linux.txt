v0.60 of a Linux port of a DOS port of a Linux port of DOOM

-This port was mostly written by Chi Hoang (cyhoang@acs.ucalgary.ca)
-A great deal of the linux improvements were contributed by
 Eduardo Casino-Almao (eduardo@medusa.es)
-Other code snippets and bug fixes were contributed by various authors
-The official DosDoom homepage now at http://www.frag.com/dosdoom
-DOOM is copyright ID software (www.idsoftware.com)
-This port is not endorsed by id software, so don't bug them about it
-I am not responsible for any damage that may be done by this program
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can get the original linux-doom source at ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/source/doomsrc.zip

Please read the readme.dos file for command-line parameters and other
notes.  

NOTE: use -vid x or -vid svga to pick whether you want the svgalib renderer
      or the x renderer.  For svgalib, dosdoom needs root privledges.

Differences from the dos port
-----------------------------
-the pause key is substituted by the Insert key
-music and cdaudio don't work yet
-You need to use -grabmouse for the mouse to work
-Configuration is now saved in ~/.doomrc   This file is NOT compatibile
 with default.cfg (well, i don't think so)
-PrintScreen for a screenshot doesn't work (i dunno how to capture the
 key in x) Just use -devparm and press f1
-Bit-depth is autodetected in x, so if you're on a 16BPP x-server, it'll
 automatically use 16BPP mode, etc
-You can use -disp displayname to change your display
-Use -geom to change window geometry (in x)

New .doomrc options:

video         -  defaults to "x". Overriden by -vid.
vid_path      -  defaults to "/usr/lib/games/doom". Directory which holds
                 the video modules.
darken_screen -  defaults to 1. If not set, screen is not darken when the
                 menu is on the screen (it looks better for me :-). This
                 applies to DJGPP DosDoom as well.

Linux Network play
------------------
Networking is totally different from the dos port and uses tcp/ip
To start a net game you use the '-net' parameter followed by the player
number of your machine (from 1 to 8) followed by the hostnames or IP's of
the other players.  If you use an IP, you MUST precede it by a period.
You can specify the port numbers of the other machines by appending a
colon followed by the port number to the hostname/IP

ie: to start a 2-player game, plyr 1 at 192.168.1.1 and plyr 2 at 192.168.1.2
  player 1: xdosdoom -net 1 .192,168.1.2 -deathmatch 
  player 2: xdosdoom -net 1 .192.168.1.1 -deathmatch

ie: to start a 2-player game on one computer without a network (like me),
    type (at an xterm):

  xdosdoom -net 1 localhost:20001 -port 20000 -nosound >& /dev/null &
  xdosdoom -net 2 localhost:20000 -port 20001 -nosound >& /dev/null &
  

The follow command line switches from the dos port are obsolete in linux:
  -hicolor	(this is autodetected)
  -forcevga	(unnecessary because we're in x)
  -readmus	(autodetected in linux)
  -readsfx	(ditto)
  -dblbuffer	(can't do that in a window)
  -cdaudio	(doesn't work)
  -digmid	(Requires allegro.  Music doesn't work anyway)
