User Notes
  -use wads from doom v1.9!!!!!!!!
  -networking should only be compatible with doom v1.9 if you don't use extra features
   (ie: everything in gameplay options must be turned off, gravity should be at default)
  -Everything in gameplay options MUST be the same for all computers in
   a network game.
  -played demos should be from doom v1.9
  -if you have an order video card without vesa2 linear frame buffer, you
   might be able to speed up doom by getting SDD at http://www.scitechsoft.com
  -On a slower machine, dosdoom is slower than the original doom.exe, while
   on a newer machine, dosdoom is faster than the original doom.exe
  -using double-buffering may improve speed significantly, but it also could
   slow things down.
  -to do networking, rename dosdoom.exe to doom2.exe and run dm.exe
   (dm.exe is DeathManager which comes with doom v1.9)
  -You could use CapLock to always run - when its on, use shift to walk
  -i pumped up maxvisplanes, maxopenings, maxdrawsegs, maxvissprites, and
   max savegame size for u level designers out there :)
  -If the DOSDOOM environ var exists, dosdoom will look in that directory
   for default.cfg
  -320x100 mode is availiable :)
  -new cheatcode: type hotaru to kill allmonsters
  -new cheat code 'showinfo', which will show fps/time/position/kills/etc
   in single player and fps/time in multiplayer
  -'showinfo', 'cdnext', 'cdprev', and 'idmus??' are allowed in deathmatch
  -MIDI support is now in DosDoom - just use the midi file in place of the
   mus file
  -To add translucency to a thing, in a DeHackEd file:
     add  536870912 to Bits line of the Thing for 25% translucency
     add 1073741824 to Bits line of the Thing for 50% translucency
     add 1610612736 to Bits line of the Thing for 75% translucency
  -You can press PrintScreen to take a screenshot at any time
  -player 5-8 starts are things 4001-4004 (for you level designers out there)
  -you need a new ipxsetup for 8 player support

New Command Line Parameters;
  -deh filename Loads a DeHackEd file
  -gwaddir dir  Sets the location of the doom wad
  -width ???    Sets x resolution to ??? (default 320)
  -height ???   sets y resolution to ??? (default 200)
  -hicolor      Enables hicolor mode
  -forcevga     Use standard vga for 320x200 even if a vesa mode is availiable
  -dblbuffer    Use hardware double buffering.  Might be faster, especially at
                hi-res and hi-color modes.  You could use timedemo to check.
                This may not work on all computers. (Note: on most video cards,
                this will be slower if you use lotsa translucency)
  -heapsize ??? Sets heapsize to ??? megabytes.  (default 6)  Increase if you
                get out of memory errors at very-high resolutions or big maps
  -censored     Use this to censor quit messages
  -cdaudio      Turns on cd-audio support.  Use the new cheat codes CDNEXT
                and CDPREV to go forward or back a track.  Use IDMUS?? to
                change to a specific track.
  -digmid       Enables software wavetable.  You will have to edit the
                included dosdoom.cfg, so that the patches= line points
                to either a default.cfg file (from a set of GUS patches)
                or a .dat file (which can be created from a SoundFont (.sf2)
                file with the pat2dat utility availiable on my webpage). You
                can get SoundFont files and GUS patches by following the links
                at http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/digmid.html
  -readmus      Read music card from default.cfg instead of trying to autodetect
  -readsfx      Read sfx card from default.cfg instead of trying to autodetect
  -nosound      Turns off all sound

These Command-line Parameters can be Configured in the Options Menu:
  -notrans      Never use translucency, even if it is specified in a custom wad
  -fulltrans    Makes fireballs and stuff like that translucent.
  -mlook        Enables mlook, so when you move the mouse up or down, it'll
                tilt your view up or down
  -invertmouse  Makes it so when you move the mouse up, your view tilts down
                and vice-versa.  Only useful with -mlook
  -vspeed       Sets the vertical speed for both -mlook and the keyboard
                look up/down keys.  (default 1000)
  -novert       Turns off vertical mouse movement.  Useful if you are used
                to +mlook.
  -newnmrespawn Makes monsters in Nightmare respawn in place
  -lessaccurate Stop monsters from being 100% accurate
  -itemrespawn  Item Respawning
  -stretchsky   Stretches Sky for Better mlooking
  -rotatemap    Makes the map view rotate, instead of having the player rotate
  -newmap       New automap-overlay mode.  Press tab to switch to it.
                (Thanks to Dave Pearson)
  -swapstereo   Swaps the stereo channels

Known Bugs:  (don't email me about them)
  -status bar shows before wipes when using double-buffering
  -very large heapsizes don't work
  -some demos get out of sync in dosdoom
  -Monster infighting and a few minor text messages don't work in .deh files
   Code frames also don't seem to work
  -Shoot up/down doesn't work in net play.  I'm still thinking of the best
   way to solve it without breaking network compatibility

Programming Notes:
  -This is for the djgpp compiler, v2.01.  Get it at www.delorie.com/djgpp/
  -You now need allegro 3.0 to compile it.  It is used for a lot of the
   dos-specific routines.  Get it at http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/
  -You also need BCD, a cd-audio playing library to compile dosdoom.  It
   is availiable at http://brennan.home.ml.org/programming/
  -I had to rename all of doom's KEY_* vars to KEYD_* because allegro also
   uses KEY_ variables
  -I commented out RANGECHECK (in doomdef.h), for more speed, if youre a
   programmer you should uncomment it
  -If you recompile my code you'll probably get an exe thats much larger
   than the one in this release.  That is because i compress my exe
   with djp (it's like pklite for djgpp programs).  DJP can probably be
   obtained from the same place you got djgpp.
