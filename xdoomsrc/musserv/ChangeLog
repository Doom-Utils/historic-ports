Changes (December 5, 1999):

  - took all CPU specific compiler options out of the makefiles,
    not really necessary.
  - removed GPL text from this directory, a copy is in doc directory
    already.

Changes (October 31, 1999):

  - fixed a EGCS warning

Changes (March 29, 1999):

  - if a PWAD was used just with the filename and without path, musserver
    always tried to use DOOMWADDIR as the path, if set and so not allowing
    to play resources from a PWAD in the current directory. Fixed so that
    it does not try to add DOOMWADDIR to files like ./mylevel.wad.

Changes (March 25, 1999):

  - Worked in the patches from Eric Lakin for FreeBSD 3.x

Changes (February 28, 1999):

  - include errno.h for Debian Linux

More changes (February 20 1999):

  - Implemented pausing and resuming of the musserver, so that it stops
    playing the song while the game is paused or the X version iconified.

More changes (May 6, 1998):

  - under Unixware 7 I'm using the OSS driver from 4Front now too,
    release 3.9-beta5. This is much better than the old driver as
    comes with the OS. Sources modified to compile in support for
    AWE32/64, playing the music on an Emu8000 MIDI Engine sounds
    sooo much better. Won't compile anymore on the OS as comes out
    of the box, upgrade your sound driver and get an AWE-64 ;-)

More changes (February 11, 1998):

  - ported to Unixware 7

More changes (February 6, 1998):

  - support for big endian machines provided by 4Front merged in

More changes (January 30, 1998):

  - didn't compile with the AWE32/64 support enabled, fixed

Changes so far I made to the latest 1.4 version (January 26, 1998):

  - Ported to Unixware 2.1 using GNU C 2.7.2 from www.freebird.com.
  - Ported to OpenServer 5 using Robert Lipes GDS from ftp.sco.com,
    does not work yet because of a bug in the OSS sound driver and
    needs more work, no /proc filesystem.
  - Platform specific makefiles and directories for the objects, I
    need that because the common source tree for the whole X Doom
    project is on my NFS server and the make dependencies don't work
    if the objects for all platforms are in the same directory.
  - Printing of pids and /proc entries changed to verbose > 1,
    the average Doom players don't need this info.
  - Some messages prefixed with "musserver: ", wasn't clear anymore,
    where a message came from for problems finding wad files and such.
  - Added support for Ultimate and Final Doom and for the french Doom][
    version.
  - Changed search order for the WADs so it's the same than in xdoom
    and sndserver.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in version 1.4 (June 14, 1997):
  - Added AWE32/AWE64 support: merged in changes from the AWE32 Sound Driver
    project.
  - Bugfix: musserver checks to see if its parent is still alive; if Doom
    exits abnormally, musserver will exit.
  - Added -c option to disable this new check.

Changes in version 1.3 (June 12, 1997):
  - Removed failed attempt at GUS support.  Next version will merge in changes
    from the Linux Ultra Sound Project's version so that it will work with
    their kernel driver.

Changes in version 1.22a (May 21, 1996):
  - Minor README changes (pandora.st.hmc.edu is no longer connected to the
    internet, so was removed from the list of sites for obtaining musserver).
  - Minor README.GUS changes (see first paragraph of README.GUS).

Changes in version 1.22 (Mar 4, 1996):

  - Exits cleanly if /dev/sequencer does not exist or is in use
  - Prints version number with verbosity > 1
  - Updates to README and README.GUS

Changes in version 1.21 (Jan 30, 1996):

  - Fixed a bug (maybe) in sequencer.c and gusload.c where GUS samples are
    reset.  I haven't heard anybody complain about it, but I'm pretty sure
    it's a bug that would prevent the GUS support from working in most cases.
  - A few README updates

Changes in version 1.2 (Jan 28, 1996):

  - Numerous changes to sequencer.c:
    - Added preliminary GUS support
    - Rewrote the code for detecting music devices
    - Many minor changes
  - Changes to musserver.c and readwad.c to reflect the GUS support
  - Three new command-line options for GUS: -8, -a, -g
  - User-configurable section in musserver.h

Changes in version 1.11 (Jan 26, 1996):

  - Very minor changes to playmus.c.  Musserver will now respond to IPC
    messages during long periods of time with no music events (ie, the long
    held notes at the beginning of the music for level 7, Doom II).
  - Musserver no longer forks to the background.  It seems that this is
    unnecessary when started from Doom, and forking leaves an extra zombie
    process around.

Changes in version 1.1 (Oct 25, 1995):

  - Added external PWAD support (patch done by Michael Bischoff
    <mbi@mo.math.nat.tu-bs.de>).  The patch requires no new command line
    options to work.  It should automatically detect any PWADs you may be
    using.

Changes in version 1.0 (Aug 23, 1995):

  - Removed the supplied kernel patches.  They are not necessary with Voxware
    3.0.1, so users are encouraged to upgrade to that instead.

Changes in version 0.99d (Aug 22, 1995):

  - Added several free() calls to fix memory allocation bugs that had gone
    previously unnoticed
  - Fixed a few verbose status messages

Changes in version 0.99c (Aug 22, 1995):

  - Added a single break; statement to fix a problem with the -t option

Changes in version 0.99b (Aug 21, 1995):

  - The FM synth octave bug (fixed in kernel 1.3.14) was "unfixed" in kernel
    1.3.18.  Thus musserver corrects for it again in the very latest kernels.
  - Added -V option to tell musserver to ignore volume change messages from
    Doom.  This seems to be necessary for some FM synth cards, for which
    Voxware's mixer support is not fully functional.
  - Musserver will not alllow both the -f and -m options to be specified,
    since they are mutually exclusive.
  - Added a troubleshooting section to the README.

Changes in version 0.99a (Aug 11, 1995):

  - If FM synth device is selected, musserver checks the date of the current
    Voxware version.  If the Voxware date is later than July 10, 1995,
    musserver does not correct for the FM octave bug (it was fixed in the
    July 28, 1995 version of Voxware).  Otherwise musserver still transposes
    notes up an octave (only in FM synth mode) to correct for the bug.

Changes in version 0.99 (Aug 9, 1995):

  - Removed all obsolete options and code (anything dealing with the user
    manually changing music selections).  Removed options include:
	-i (do not play intermission)
	-k (kill existing musserver and start new process)
	-n (play next music)
	-p (play previous music)
	-s (play secret music)
	-t (terminate musserver)
	-w (warp to level)
	-W (warp to level while currently running)
  - Added new -t option, to specify timeout in seconds when waiting to get
    the IPC message queue id.  Default is 300.

Changes in version 0.98 (Aug 9, 1995):

  - Includes version 1.1 of the Doom executable patch by Steffen Winterfeld.
    This patch appears to work perfectly, and will probably be the last one.
  - Volume changes now work for FM synth mode.
  - Volume changes are now based on a logarithmic, rather than linear, scale

Changes in version 0.97 (Aug 8, 1995):

  - Includes the first version of a Doom executable patch (by Steffen
    Winterfeld) that allows Doom itself to control musserver.  Various changes
    were made to IPC message handling to accommodate the Doom patch.
  - Volume changes (from the Doom "Options" menu) now work for general midi.
  - I decided not to release this version since the Doom patch would soon be
    revised

Changes in version 0.96a (July 28, 1995):

  - Musserver now recognizes music resource names when receiving IPC messages.
    When it receives a valid resource name in a message, it begins playing
    the music corresponding to that name.  This is in hopes of hacking the
    Doom executable to automatically tell musserver when to change music.

Changes in version 0.96 (July 27, 1995):

  - Added support for Thy Flesh Consumed (Doom I, episode 4).  Ultimate Doom
    level numbers follow the same format as the first 3 episodes of Doom I:
    42 means E4M2, or level 2 of Thy Flesh Consumed.

Changes in version 0.95 (July 26, 1995):

  - Added -W option to warp levels while musserver is currently running
  - The -n, -p, and -s options now use IPC messages instead of kill(2)
    signals.  This should not have changed anything as far as the end user is
    concerned.
  - More error checking, better cleanup upon exit

Changes in version 0.94a (July 22, 1995):

  - After talking to Hannu Savolainen, the author of Voxware, I decided to
    implement FM pitch bending in a slightly different way.  The required
    kernel patch has also changed.  These changes have no effect for general
    midi users.

Changes in version 0.94 (July 19, 1995):

  - Pitch bending now works for FM synth mode.  Bending the note up should
    work fine "out of the box," but bending the note down will not work
    without the supplied kernel patch.  See the README for details.
  - Added preliminary support for IPC messages.  All musserver does upon
    receiving a message is echo it back, along with some other information.
    The file ipc.c is a quick program I wrote to send IPC message to
    musserver.  This is useful only for testing, but feel free to try it out.

Changes in version 0.93 (June 29, 1995):

  - Forks to the background in normal mode, unless -v (verbose) is set
  - Waits for a signal before playing the first song
  - Fixed bug in warping to levels 31 and 32 (Doom II)
  - Fixed bug that allowed warping to invalid levels (Doom I)
  - Continued improvement in FM synth playback.  Everything seems to work
    except for main volume, panning, pitch bend, and a few percussion
    instruments.

Changes in version 0.92 (June 27, 1995):

  - Adjusted timing factor so music is the same tempo as in Dos
  - Renamed midi.c to sequencer.c (seemed more appropriate)
  - FM synth playback has improved significantly, but is not perfect yet

Changes in version 0.91 (June 24, 1995):

  - Added -l option to list detected music devices
  - Added -u option to choose device type to use

Version 0.9:  First public release (June 22, 1995)
