If you run this PWAD make sure you have set messages on in the game engine.
The scripts print some messages and this is done with the standard Doom
message handling for now, so if messages are off one won't see them.

Don't start shooting the trooper, he's facing the wall by purpose and
can't see you. Wait a bit until the scripts are doing their stuff and
watch the fun.

Also don't shoot the barrels, go into the sector with lowered floor
and ceiling lights. This also gets rid of the trooper, if you resisted
so far to shoot him :-)

You can stop and restart the wall texture switch animation by walking
into this section. This switch is not usable, is just some wall animation
played with a script.

Try pushing the machine with the scrolling texture on it.

Don't run into the laser or you're toast, better switch it off :-)
