This PWAD is a demonstration of the Tutti Frutti Effect (aka TFE) bug in
engines distributed by id. The problem is caused by short textures which
are not tiled correctly in the rendering engine. Most Doom engine ports
have fixed this problem, however, XDoom can be compiled with bugs fixed
and without. So use this PWAD to test if XDoom was compiled with the bug
fixes.

The level just is one small room with a switch. If the switch is pressed
stairs raise from the floor in the middle of the room. The front of the
steps have a short lower texture. If the stairs look OK then the engine
was compiled with bug fixes. If not random colored pixels are displayed
on the front of the steps.
