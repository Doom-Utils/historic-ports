sldoor.map		- Level map created with tkwadcad.
sldoor.wgc		- Input file for wadgc to create the door texture.
gdoor*.ppm		- Images in PPM P6 format for the door texture.
comtxt.txt		- Resource file for UAC communication gadget.

All door graphics done from scratch by Andre Majorel (amajorel@teaser.fr).
Andre released the door graphics as Public Domain, so you are allowed to
use them in your own PWAD's and redistribute them. It sure would be nice
if you give credit to Andre for his art work, if you use his textures.

The level map self was done by Andre with Yadex and me with tkwadcad. We
passed it forth and back and we both contributed to it, it was a lot of
fun until the door finaly worked perfect.
