Sun Dec  5 12:22:37 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

	* took all CPU specific optimization out of makefiles,
	  not really necessary.

Sun Oct 31 02:38:02 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

	* Fixed a EGCS warning.

Sat Oct 30 13:46:21 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

	* Renamed linux.c to oss.c, that module implements the API
	  to the OSS sound driver and that ain't Linux only.

Sat Oct 23 12:26:53 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

	* Re-licensed under GPL.

Mon Jun 21 02:42:24 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

	* Reformatted to the same style than used for xdoom.

Wed Jun 09 23:25:01 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

	* Added sfx for comdev gadget, so that the program doesn't
	  terminate because it should play an unknown sfx.

Sun May  9 16:30:01 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

	* Merging sfx frpm PWADs doesn't work correct, disabled for now.

Mon Apr  5 15:07:30 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

	* More patches from Eric Lakin for FreeBSD 3.x

Thu Mar 25 12:06:21 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

	* Worked in the patches from Eric Lakin for FreeBSD 3.x.

Tue Feb 16 06:58:02 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

	* Reset of the DSP still was done and it causes problems with
	  the older sound driver, commented out.

Sun Feb 14 01:58:49 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

	* There was a warning left because <sys/ioctl.h> wasn't
	  included, fixed.

	* Modified openwad(), so that it can merge sfx lumps from
	  pwads.

	* Modified even more to optionally load the new chaingun sound
	  from xdoom.wad, if not found use pistol sound. This is a real
	  gross hack I'm not proud about and I can only hope no one
	  looks into this shit. The whole sndserver supports as it is
	  belongs into the trash can and should be rewritten from scratch
	  with an appropriate design, which allows more flexibility. One
	  day I might do that...

Fri Jan 29 21:08:34 1999	<um@compuserve.com>

	* Raised the sound volume, so that it's similar to other
	  applications playing sfx sound output.

Wed Apr 22 19:55:46 1998	<udo@umserver.umnet.de>

	* If the DSP device is busy or no sound card available
	  sndserver now continues to work, just without playing
	  the sounds. So XDoom continues to work too in this case
	  and doesn't terminate anymore.

Tue Mar  3 18:35:53 1998	<udo@umserver.umnet.de>

	* 8 bit sound support improved like done for the xdoom
	  builtin sound handling, see xdoom's log file too.

Wed Feb 11 13:36:50 1998	<udo@umserver.umnet.de>

	* Ported to Unixware 7.

Mon Jan 26 13:03:35 1998	<udo@umserver.umnet.de>

	* Added test for environment variable DOOM_SOUND_SAMPLEBITS
	  to override detection of a 16bit sound card and activate
	  conversion to 8bit sound samples. There are 16bit sound
	  cards which aren't SoundBlaster compatible and changing
	  the sources to force it playing 8bit samples worked with
	  this sound card. I added this environment variable,
	  so people won't need to modify the source anymore.

	* Support for tnt.wad and plutonia.wad added

	* Changed order so that sndserver looks for the WADs
	  in the same order then xdoom does.

Thu Jan  1 16:47:37 1998	<udo@umserver.umnet.de>

	* This ChangeLog added, who knows how much work will
	  be done here, so it's better to have separate log
	  for sndserver too.

	* The sound card initialization sequence was the opposite
	  as the 4Front OSS documentation says, how this should
	  be done. It might cause problems with some sound cards,
	  I don't know, I just fixed it and it's a better style
	  anyway to coincide with documented API's.

Wed Dec 31 1997			<udo@umserver.umnet.de>

	* Sound support for 8bit sound cards added. The server
	  detected the sample format capabilities of the sound
	  hardware already and the conversion from the signed
	  short sounds samples to 8bit unsigned is pretty easy
	  to do. Also I modified the text output, so that it
	  just shows which type of card it's using, instead of
	  the original error message, if the hardware isn't
	  able to play the 16bit signed samples.
	  This should work with all PC UNIX's, but I have tested
	  it under UW 2.1.2 only, because that is the only system
	  I have with old 8bit sound hardware.
