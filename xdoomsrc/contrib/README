The xdoom.sh shell script template was contributed by Ron Record (rr@sco.com).
If you have more than one of the id Software titles, like Doom and Doom II
and Final Doom, copy the script to /usr/local/bin as doom, doom2, tnt and
so on. Then modify the DOOMWADDIR variable in each script to point to the
directory with the IWAD file for the title. If you wish to play the TNT
episode from Final Doom just type tnt and off you go.

The sxdoom.sh script was derived from xdoom.sh and does the same for the
[S]VGA full screen version of the program on various platforms.

Same with glxdoom.sh, this one is for Voodoo 3DFX graphic cards, only
supported under Linux with the Glide library from 3DFX.

showkey.c is a program to show the scan codes of keyboards on PC UNIX's,
when the keyboard is switched into raw (scan code) mode. For compiling
on PC UNIX's use:

Linux:			cc -DLINUX showkey.c -o showkey
Openserver5:		cc -DSCOOS5 showkey.c -o showkey
Unixware2, Unixware7:	cc -DSCOUW showkey.c -o showkey

Then run the program and hit the keys, for which you need to know the
scan code. The program terminates if there isn't any input for 10 seconds.
