The following list should show all companies, organizations and persons
who worked on this project and contributed something. If someone who
contributed isn't mentioned it is my fault, please email me so that
I can correct it. The list is in no particular order, I just keep
adding as stuff comes in here, but of course id Software is mentioned
first, without them this project won't exist.

id Software: http://www.idsoftware.com

    * For writing one kind of a great game, which redefined computer
      game playing.
    * For releasing the sources to the public and allow us to mess with it.
    * For using UNIX systems too.

Bernd Kreimeier: bk@gamers.org

    * For taking the time to clean up the project before it was released.

Raven Software: http://www.ravensoft.com

    * For the Hexen game engine, XDoom includes some features from this
      engine, like the ACS P code interpreter and linedefs/things with
      arguments.
    * For releasing the sources to the public and allow us to mess with it.

Hank Leukart: ap641@cleveland.freenet.edu

    * For the very detailed FAQ.

4Front Technologies: http://www.4front-tech.com

    * For providing me with up to date sound drivers for all platforms.
    * For patiently answering my questions about the OSS API and the
      sound drivers.
    * For the initial integration of musserver into xdoom.
    * For the big endian support for musserver.

Michael Heasley: mheasley@hmc.edu

    * For writing 'musserver', so that we are able to enjoy the Doom tunes
      under UNIX.

Larry Plona: ljp@tiac.net

    * For the idea with the skull menu, the Java-Script code and gif images
      for the xdoom web page.
    * For reading through the whole documentation and improving it
      significantly.
    * For bringing me on track with the big/little endian mess in xdoom.

The Linux crowd: http://www.linux.org

    * The sources id released are for Linux. Without Linux there never
      might have been public released Doom sources, who knows.

The Skunkware crew: http://www.sco.com/skunkware

    * The Skunkware crew is a gang of software developers and SCO
      engineers who put a lot of effort into porting freeware to
      SCO OS's and help people to get their hands on this stuff.
      Thanks for answering my questions about SCO OS's and providing
      help with all kind of technical problems.

Achim Oppelt: aoppelt@theorie3.physik.uni-erlangen.de

    * For the patch which enables xdoom to work on X servers with
      16, 24 and 32 bpp.

Klaus ter Fehn: ktf@gun.de

    * For helping out with some nasty Tcl/Tk details in xdlaunch, which
      I couldn't figure out my self from Brent B. Welch's book.

Ron Record: rr@sco.com

    * For the top level Makefile and the xdoom.sh template.

TeamTNT: http://www.neosoft.com/~teamtnt

    * I took Lee Killough's C drawing routines with the TFE fix from
      the Boom sources and worked them into xdoom.
    * I also took Lee Killough's x86 assembler drawing routines with
      the TFE fix from the Boom sources and worked them into xdoom.
    * The idea about "not deathmatch" and "not cooperative" thing flags
      I took from Boom too.
    * Also from Boom I took the thinker based scrolling functions and
      implemented a part of them into xdoom. I believe the thinker based
      scroll functions in Boom were written by Lee Killough.
    * Took Lee's Medusa fix from Boom sources too.
    * Used Lee's dynamic visplane, openings and visplane allocation sources
      from Boom.
    * The menu pictures with text 'horizontal' and 'vertical' are from
      the Boom resource wad, I just made the images a bit smaller though.
      However, credit for this graphics is due to some artist from
      TeamTNT.
    * Dynamic allocated drawsegs, which fix the 2s line HOM, are from Boom.
    * Silent teleporters are from Boom.
    * TeamTNT has improved the linedefs used in the Doom engine by adding
      a more complete set of triggers. It is way too much to mention those
      all in detail, but all the Boom based triggers implemented in XDoom
      are based on sources from TeamTNT. The SPEC.xdoom document lists all
      currently implemented, see there.

Andre Majorel <amajorel@teaser.fr>

   * For the improved PWAD lookup in /usr/(local)/share/doom.
   * For pointing out the xdoom crashes on a map with thing id 0.
   * For making me overwork the top level makefile and use GNUmakefile
     to autodetect, if GNU make is used.
   * For contributing the sliding door textures and providing me with
     ideas for making them work.
   * For usable bug reports, feedback and supporting me with ideas in general.
   * For bothering me about removing the static limitations, like it was
     done in Boom by TeamTNT. If Andre hadn't complained about this enough,
     the limitations still might be there. It was a lot of work but worth it.
   * For testing and bug reports of XDoomPlus.

Alan Curry <pacman@cqc.com>

   * For a lot of feedback and bug reports.
   * For various bug fixes in XDoom and the tools.
   * For mklinux support on Apple PPC hardware.

Colin Phipps <cph@lxdoom.linuxgames.com>

   * I took the idea about giving up CPU while waiting for XSHM finishing
     the blitting out of Colin's lxdoom sources. Lxdoom is a port of
     DOS Boom to Linux.
   * I also took the idea about polling the mouse pointer every game tic
     instead of handling X events for it from the same source.

Eric Lakin <elakin@ricochet.net>

   * For the patches for XDoom, sndserver and musserver to compile
     under FreeBSD 3.x

Oliver Kraus <olikraus@yahoo.com>

   * For bug fixes for Solaris 2.x on SPARC.
   * For figuring out how to compile with Sun's WorkShop compiler.
   * For optimization on 32bpp Sun SPARC X servers.

Priit Jaerv <priit@mig.ee>

   * For the FreeBSD ioctl() module for CD audio.
   * For the FreeBSD VGA frame buffer module using libvgl.

John Davison <davisoja@yahoo.com>

   * For help with structure align problems on AIX and making sure the
     commercial IWAD's work OK under AIX.
