WAD data files include binary data which always is in little endian byte
order. To compile on systems with big endian byte order the define -DBIGEND
must be set in the makefiles for the platform, else the programs abort with
an error message or dump core, because the read data is junk.

WAD data files also include some data in structures and a structure alignment
of 2 bytes is assumed, which is the default for x86 environments.
This structure alignment is not optimal on other platforms and different
alignment is used by default. The sources include appropriate #pragma pack
directives, but unfortunately some compilers ignore them. If you use GNU C
or EGCS this should work on most platforms (doesn't work under AIX), but
other compilers require a command line option for different structure
alignment. RTFM and make sure you use an option for 2 byte alignment, else
the programs won't work.

The assumption was made that char variables by default are signed, which
is not true on every platform. Usually the compiler on such platforms
has an option to force signed char variables. For GNU C use -fsigned-char,
for other compilers RTFM.
