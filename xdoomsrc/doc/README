Welcome to XDoom - Where everyone's favorite game meets everyone's favorite
operating system. If you thought that UNIX was only good for making a
living, guess again. Now you can put that high priced computer hardware
to work destroying demons of all shapes and sizes.

XDoom is a UNIX/X11 version of the commercial game Doom.  XDoom is however
free and available as source code. Commercial Doom data files (wads) may be
used with XDoom, but must be purchased.

XDoom does work with the shareware version of the Doom 1 wad, just like
shareware Doom for DOS. This allows a limited portion of the Doom game to be
played. To play the full Doom 1 game, Doom II or third party wads, commercial
wads must be used. The same wads sold by id software and retail stores will
work with XDoom.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Supported Platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------

XDoom is known to work on the following platforms:

    SCO UnixWare 7, X11 and [S]VGA support, mouse and keyboard support
    SCO UnixWare 2.1.x, X11 and [S]VGA support, mouse and keyboard support
    SCO OpenServer 5.0.x, X11 and [S]VGA support, mouse and keyboard support
    Linux x86 1.2.x, 2.0.x, 2.1.x and 2.2.x, X11, [S]VGA and Voodoo 3DFX
	support, mouse, keyboard and joystick support
    Linux Dec Alpha 2.2.x, X11 support, no sound yet, mouse and keyboard support
    FreeBSD 3.x, X11 and [S]VGA support, mouse and keyboard support
    Solaris SPARC 2.5.1, 2.6 and 2.7 X11 support, no sound yet,
	mouse and keyboard
    IBM AIX 4.2, X11 support, no sound yet, mouse and keyboard support

XDoom can probably be made to work on any version of UNIX which runs X11.
Dependent on the console driver of the OS full screen direct graphics
support is possible too, enough implementation examples are included
to see how this can be done on various OS's. If X11 runs on the console
XDoom can be made to run in full screen graphics mode on the console too.

In case of technical problems feel free to email me at um@compuserve.com,
but please don't bother me about how to play the game and cheats, this is
explained in great detail in the included documentation.
I cannot guarantee that I can solve your problem, I'm doing this in my spare
time for the fun of it, this software is provided on AS IS basis.

Building XDoom from Source
------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the file "INSTALL".

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting UNIX Sound Drivers
------------------------------------------------------------------------

4-Front Technology has commercial drivers for most versions of UNIX. These
drivers are reasonably priced for the home user. Free OS's like Linux and
FreeBSD come with a 'Lite' version of this driver. SCO offers a free version
of this driver for SCO UnixWare and SCO OpenServer.

When using any 4-Front driver, make sure that it's version 3.8 or later.

Commercial 4-Front drivers

    http://www.4front-tech.com

Free 4-Front drivers for UnixWare and OpenServer

    http://www.sco.com/skunkware/audiovis/index.html

There is also a free sound driver with source code variously called
Voxware, USS/Lite and OSS/Free.

    http://www.4front-tech.com/ossfree

For Linux systems there also exists a PC speaker driver and the driver
emulates a sound card with the OSS API. This driver is available at
http://www.imladris.demon.co.uk/pcsp/patch-pcsp-soundcore-2.1.126.
and it was reported that XDoom plays sound with this driver too.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using musserver with Creative AWE sound cards
------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default musserver is compiled to play the music via the OPL FM
synthesizer on sound cards, because probably all sound cards will
support this and because that's what most people have. If you are
using a Creative AWE 32 or AWE 64 sound card, you got one with a pretty
good MIDI engine, which sounds way better than the FM synthesizer. The
OSS sound drivers do support this Emu8000 MIDI engine on the AWE cards
and so does musserver. AWE support is compiled in, just not used by
default. So if you wish to play the tunes with the Emu8000 MIDI engine
modify the shell wrapper for the musserver program:

/usr/local/games/xdoom/musserver

#!/bin/sh
exec musserver.bin -a $*

Works too out of the box with the sound driver included in Linux x86 2.2
kernels.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using CD audio support
------------------------------------------------------------------------

CD audio support differs a lot on all the different UNIX's, so an abstract
layer was added to XDoom, which allows to write further CD audio support
modules without more modifications in the game engine it self. There are
two working support modules implemented, one uses Ti Kan's cda audio player
program, the other uses the ioctl() interface used in Linux/BSD/Solaris.
If you are running XDoom on a system without an ioctl() interface for
CD audio support and you wish to use CD audio support, you need to install
Ti Kan's xmcd CD audio player program on your system. The program can be
found at:

http://sunsite.unc.edu/~cddb/xmcd/welcome.html

You don't have a good audio CD to play together with XDoom? Well, there
is one, check out:

http://www.bpmusic.com/latest.html

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using a Voodoo 3DFX as framebuffer
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under Linux XDoom can be compiled to run on a Voodoo 3DFX framebuffer in
full screen mode with a resolution of 640x400 and 16/24bit color depth.
This was tested with Glide 2.4 from www.3dfx.com and with Glide 2.46
from glide.xxedgexx.com including the driver module. Use the later one,
XDoom won't need root permission then to run. You also need the SVGA
library, because the 3DFX DGA module uses the mouse support from this
library. This was developed and tested with svgalib 1.3.1, other releases
might cause problems.
I don't know if the Glide library is available for anything other than
Linux x86 and Microsoft OS's, check out http://www.3dfx.com.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joystick support
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Joystick support is enabled in the Makefile for Linux x86, the 2.2 kernel
includes the driver already. For 2.0 release you can find the driver at:

	http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~vojtech/joystick/

Linux x86 is the only OS with Joystick support currently, I'm not aware
about drivers for other OS's. If you know about free drivers for other OS's
let me know where to find them and I might try to add support for this.

To disable Joystick support for Linux x86 edit
xdoomsrc/xdoom/Makefile.linux-x86 and remove -DUSE_JOYSTICK from the GAMEOPT
define. Also comment the JOYSTICK define below and uncomment the empty one.

After you got XDoom compiled with Joystick support you need to enable
it in your ~/.doomrc, change use_joystick from 0 to 1 for this. By default
usage of the Joystick is disabled in ~/.doomrc. Also you can configure
up to 4 buttons there.

I used an analog Logitech Wingman Joystick and it works OK for me. There is
no Joystick calibration, because the driver documentation says the driver
does it internally and besides this it comes with a calibration program
'jscal'. So use that after you loaded the appropriate driver modules.

I have no clue how sensitive other Joysticks are and which range of
values the driver returns for the axes. If it is too sensitive or not
sensitive enough change the threshold defines in i_ljoy.c. Also I would
appreciate an email if the default values won't work for you, because
then I might have to add some sort of calibration procedure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use with Commercial Doom Products
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The XDoom source is free software distributed under the GNU license. The
unregistered version of the Doom 1 wad file is also free. The unregistered
wad contains one of the three Doom 1 episodes. The unregistered wad will not
play the other two Doom 1 episodes, nor will it play third party Doom wads.
Registration will activate all episodes and allow the use of third party
wads. Registration is explained in Doom's online documentation at
http://www.idsoftware.com.

Registration is not the only way to expand XDoom. The following retail
products are also available for use with XDoom:

Ultimate Doom (Doom SE) - This is a retail version of Doom 1. It contains
the three episodes of Doom 1 plus an extra episode. Purchasing Ultimate
Doom is the same as registering Doom 1.

Doom II - The Doom II wad will run without Doom 1 registration. It will
also enable the ability to play Doom II third party wads.

Final Doom - This comes with two new IWADs, Plutonia and TNT, which will run
without Doom 1 registration. Both IWADs also will enable the ability to play
Doom II third party wads.

Depths of Doom Trilogy - This is a retail package containing Ultimate
Doom, Doom II and The Doom Master Levels.

Note that all of these products are sold as DOS/Windows software. Do not be
discouraged, they work just fine with XDoom. Installation is explained below.

Some Doom products can also be purchased from Id software on their WEB site.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Executing XDoom
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run XDoom an IWAD file must be available. This is one of doom1.wad,
doom.wad, doom2.wad, doom2f.wad, doomu.wad, plutonia.wad or tnt.wad. Only
one IWAD should be presented to XDoom. XDoom will search either the current
directory or the directory specified by the DOOMWADDIR environment variable.

To play a third party Doom wad one of the above files other than doom1.wad
must be found.  The third party wad can then be specified on the command line
with "-file <path to wad>".

The PATH environment variable is searched for the sndserver and musserver
executables. These need not be present to play XDoom but are required for
sound. If they are missing XDoom will work, just without sound and/or music.

Demo files always are expected to be in the current directory and will
be written there too.

Here is one way to set up XDoom for a multi-user UNIX system, this is
what the top level makefile will do if not modified:

Install the xdoom, sndserver and musserver shell wrappers in a common location
such as /usr/local/bin. Install the binary executables in
/usr/local/games/xdoom. Also install each IWAD into /usr/local/games/xdoom.

For each user on the system, create Doom areas for each IWAD file. Each area
should contain a symbolic link to a single IWAD.

    $HOME/.doom/doom.wad@     --> /usr/local/games/xdoom/doom.wad
    $HOME/.doom2/doom2.wad@   --> /usr/local/games/xdoom/doom2.wad

To execute the above example (Doom II), simply enter the directory and
execute "xdoom". If you wish to play a third party Doom II wad, add
"-file <wad>" to the xdoom command line.
You need to do the same for the xdoom.wad file included in the data directory,
the installation will copy it into /usr/local/games/xdoom. This PWAD file
includes new resources, which aren't in the id Software IWAD files and XDoom
only works, if this resources are found.

The environment variable "DOOM_SOUND_SAMPLEBITS" may be set to force 8 bit
sound to be used.

When playing XDoom on a local console, make sure that the DISPLAY environment
variable is set to ":0.0" and not "hostname:0.0". Use of the latter will
cause shared memory to be disabled.

Ultimate Doom - The CD for Ultimate Doom contains a wad named "doom.wad".
For older XDoom releases this wad file must be renamed to "doomu.wad" in
order to play all four episodes. With this release it's not necessary
to rename the wad file anymore, the fourth episode will be auto detected.

Master Levels - The Doom Master levels is a CD containing lots of Doom 1
and Doom II third party wad files. The files can be found in:

    maximum/wads/doom1
    maximum/wads/doom2

The wads may be played from the CD or copied onto a hard drive. Note that
the Doom 1 (or Ultimate Doom) IWAD must be present to play Doom 1 wads
and the Doom II IWAD must be present to play the Doom II wads.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I play Doom?  What are the cheat codes?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

XDoom is almost the same as the DOS version. Instructions about how to
play the game are in the file INSTRUCTIONS, which is the same as is
distributed with DOS Doom. Also the fairly comprehensive Doom FAQ,
dmfaq666.txt can be found in the doc directory of the XDoom source tree.
And also read the manual page xdoom.6, found in the doc directory too.
One additional cheat code was added to XDoom so far:

	IDBEHOLDB	- Get the ammo backpack

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boom compatibility
------------------------------------------------------------------------

XDoom has implemented some extended features from Boom by TeamTNT.
This includes scrolling floors and ceilings, with floors being able to
carry objects. It also includes independent lighting for the sector, its
floor and its ceiling. Also some silent teleportes are implemented. While
there is a PWAD included, which I use for testing the compatibility of this
features, this one won't be great fun to play. So, are there any Boom
levels which really do play OK? Certainly, so far I found the following
Boom levels playing OK. You really should get them and have a look,
because this levels are much better than what I can do.

	foa.wad
	lih.wad			all 4 levels ok
	kboom_2.wad
	hl.wad, hltextur.wad	level with Half-Life textures

You should be able to find this Boom levels on ftp.cdrom.com.

So how does one test if a Boom level is OK to play with XDoom and doesn't
use features, not implemented in XDoom?

This is easy, get xwadtools from ftp.cdrom.com, same place where you got
XDoom. This tools include the WAD editor tkwadcad, which supports all
features implemented in XDoom and it has WAD consistency checking builtin.
Make sure you use a xwadtools release with the same release date than the
XDoom release you have. So, to check if a PWAD would play with XDoom do this:

- First decompile the level map from the PWAD:
	wadldc -g XDoom MAP01 foa.wad foa.map

- Then load the map into tkwadcad:
	tkwadcad foa.map

Make sure the game version is set to XDoom, so that the consistency
checker works with the XDoom features. Then from the Check menu run all
check functions other than 'Tag references'. If no function complains
about an unknown sector type, unknown thing id or unknown linedef type,
then this PWAD should play OK with XDoom. Please note that the consistency
checks are very thorough, on large maps they will need a long time to complete.
It can need some minutes to finish a test, even on fast systems. This is
normal, just be patient.

If you check other levels this way and find some which are OK and not
listed above, I would appreciate an email, so that it can be listed
here, thank you.

Original Readme from ID
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here it is, at long last.  The DOOM source code is released for your
non-profit use.  You still need real DOOM data to work with this code.
If you don't actually own a real copy of one of the DOOMs, you should
still be able to find them at software stores.

Many thanks to Bernd Kreimeier for taking the time to clean up the
project and make sure that it actually works.  Projects tends to rot if
you leave it alone for a few years, and it takes effort for someone to
deal with it again.

The bad news:  this code only compiles and runs on linux.  We couldn't
release the dos code because of a copyrighted sound library we used
(wow, was that a mistake -- I write my own sound code now), and I
honestly don't even know what happened to the port that microsoft did
to windows.

Still, the code is quite portable, and it should be straightforward to
bring it up on just about any platform.

I wrote this code a long, long time ago, and there are plenty of things
that seem downright silly in retrospect (using polar coordinates for
clipping comes to mind), but overall it should still be a useful base
to experiment and build on.

The basic rendering concept -- horizontal and vertical lines of constant
Z with fixed light shading per band was dead-on, but the implementation
could be improved dramatically from the original code if it were
revisited.  The way the rendering proceeded from walls to floors to
sprites could be collapsed into a single front-to-back walk of the bsp
tree to collect information, then draw all the contents of a subsector
on the way back up the tree.  It requires treating floors and ceilings
as polygons, rather than just the gaps between walls, and it requires
clipping sprite billboards into subsector fragments, but it would be
The Right Thing.

The movement and line of sight checking against the lines is one of the
bigger misses that I look back on.  It is messy code that had some
failure cases, and there was a vastly simpler (and faster) solution
sitting in front of my face.  I used the BSP tree for rendering things,
but I didn't realize at the time that it could also be used for
environment testing.  Replacing the line of sight test with a bsp line
clip would be pretty easy.  Sweeping volumes for movement gets a bit
tougher, and touches on many of the challenges faced in quake / quake2
with edge bevels on polyhedrons.

Some project ideas:

Port it to your favorite operating system.

Add some rendering features -- transparency, look up / down, slopes,
etc.

Add some game features -- weapons, jumping, ducking, flying, etc.

Create a packet server based internet game.

Create a client / server based internet game.

Do a 3D accelerated version.  On modern hardware (fast pentium + 3DFX)
you probably wouldn't even need to be clever -- you could just draw the
entire level and get reasonable speed.  With a touch of effort, it should
easily lock at 60 fps (well, there are some issues with DOOM's 35 hz
timebase...).  The biggest issues would probably be the non-power of two
texture sizes and the walls composed of multiple textures.


I don't have a real good guess at how many people are going to be
playing with this, but if significant projects are undertaken, it would
be cool to see a level of community cooperation.  I know that most early
projects are going to be rough hacks done in isolation, but I would be
very pleased to see a coordinated 'net release of an improved, backwards
compatible version of DOOM on multiple platforms next year.

Have fun.
