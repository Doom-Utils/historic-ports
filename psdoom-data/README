This directory contains some custom process management levels for psDooM.

NOTE: Be sure not to have a more recent version of these data files than
      the release of psDooM you're using.  Newer data files may not work
      properly with an older version of psDooM.

To install the custom levels, copy them to the psDooM program directory
(default is /usr/local/games/psdoom/).


Custom level explanation from the psDooM README:

If you have registered Doom 1, Ultimite Doom, or Doom 2, you can use a
custom level designed for process management.  There is one level designed
for Doom 1 (psdoom1.wad) and another designed for Doom 2 (psdoom2.wad).
If those files are present (or linked to) in the program's directory and
have the correct name (as given above), the level will automatically load
as E1M1 or MAP01, unless suppressed with the command line flag:

 -nopslev
   Suppresses the automatic loading of the custom level psdoom*.wad and
   makes psDooM assume pid monster coordinates for the stock E1M1 or
   MAP01.  It has no effect if you don't have the custom level or if
   you're using shareware Doom 1.

NOTE: The command 'ps-xdoom -nopslev -file psdoom1.wad' will not work for
process management.  While the custom level will be loaded, psDooM would
assume E1M1 coordinates for the 'pid monster' placement.  The E1M1
coordinates do not correlate to anywhere meaningful on the psdoom*.wad
maps.

A small description of the custom levels:

  You spawn in a room with equiptment and weapons.  The switch ahead of
  you exits the level, and the three doors take you to rooms containing
  'pid monsters'.


If you're interested in making your own custom level for psDooM:

  *Any* level that has 3 1024x1024 areas for monster spawning such that
  the bottom left coordinates of the squares are at (0,0); (2048,0); and
  (4096,0), respectively, will work.
