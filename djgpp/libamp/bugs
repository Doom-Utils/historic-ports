1. Realtime related bugs
   ---------------------
   Sajber Jukebox support doesn't work with realtime amp, you
   just can't have both in _this_ version.

   Also, decoding to a file doesn't work as well. Bummer.

2. Sound Quality
   -------------
   Bear in mind that amp is written from scratch so some bugs might 
   have crept in. If a certain mp3 file gives you a particularly hard 
   time, you can notify me and help me track the cause. mp2 files 
   should not cause problems.

3. Configure related problems
   --------------------------
   I only recently started cleaning up configure, so it's not in
   the best of health. SunOs and Solaris in particular don't work
   that well (code itself is OK, mind you).
