amp0.7 TODO file
================

### immediate

more carefully set audio parameters, report errors, etc..

clearly separate three components from Thomas Sailer's rtbuf.c (prefetch, realtime
privs and direct-to-DMA audio) so that any one of these could be enabled/disabled
at runtime (for instance, users of GUS should be able to switch to write/audio)

make guis really use the -gui option (consult with Edouard for xmpeg3 and Joel
for Jukebox), merge.

uncomment the -include .depend line in the makefile if we're using GNU Make

amigaOS port

8bit output

qtamp

nt port

netbsd port

HP term support

karl's optimization patches

budor's optimization patches

Get rid of the nch global variable - even better, get rid of a lot of global
variables. Try reducing the memory footprint.

Synchronisation code needs to be improved still. (Sanity checks enhanced, take
a look at test2.mp3 which wrongly reports fs of 48000)

add an option to pick device file (instead of /dev/dsp)



### not so immediate

implement parse-only mode - should be useful, also quality debug output

clean up wave header writing

layer 1

CRC checking

httpget ("streaming")
