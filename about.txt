What is this release?
---------------------------------------------------------

This release of BOOM does not involve any changes in the binaries or
sources from the v2.02 release, it is simply a relicensing of BOOM
under the GPL. The old license file DOOMLIC.TXT has been replaced by
a new one, COPYING, copied verbatim from the pages of the GNU
organization (Free Software Foundation). This was undertaken only
after permission had been obtained from all copyright holders: id
Software, Chi Hoang, Lee Killough, Jim Flynn, Rand Phares, and Ty
Halderman.

The main purpose of relicensing was to clear the path for works derived
from BOOM to also relicense under the GPL if they wish.

Note that this license only applies to this executable engine and its
sources. All artwork, sounds, music, and other intellectual property of
DOOM is not affected by this license.

Any questions regarding the license for BOOM should be sent to:
